# Jinja: Advanced Level Tags

Jinja, often referred to as template tags or expression tags, provides a powerful way to operate on data from a database. There are two main types of Jinja tags:

# 1. Jinja Printing Tags

Jinja printing tags are primarily used for taking data from the backend to the frontend for displaying the data.

# 2. Jinja Operation Tags

Jinja operation tags are used to take data from the database and perform operations to fetch that data.
